"Sr. Software Engineer, Windows Vulnerability Research & Detection (Remote)","CrowdStrike is looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join our growing Content Research & Integration Tactical team within the EndPoint Protection Content group, which focuses on vulnerability research, exploit mitigations, and security-related endpoint development on the Windows operating system.     The Endpoint Protection Content group plays a central role in fulfilling CrowdStrike’s mission to Stop Breaches. Within the Content Research & Integration Tactical team (CRI-Tactical), we research the latest common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) to develop tools and techniques that expand sensor visibility and explore ways to detect advanced malicious behavior on customer endpoint devices. Our goal is to enable the sensor to autonomously identify and stop N-day tools, techniques, and procedures where possible, and to provide useful visibility and guidance to security analysts when new previously unknown adversary activity occurs.     As a senior software engineer within the CRI Tactical team, you will be focused on the analysis and development of detections for attack techniques across supported Windows OS versions. You’ll work collaboratively to implement detection logic within the Falcon sensor which includes both user-mode and kernel-mode components that together observe system activity, recognize malicious behavior, provide on-box prevention and remediation capabilities, and send relevant security related telemetry to the Falcon Cloud. You’ll help find creative and resourceful ways to detect Windows specific threats while also helping to develop cross-platform features that leverage telemetry from common OS subsystems such as file system, memory, process, and network activity. You’ll get exposure to both user-mode and kernel-mode coding practices.     As a Senior Software Engineer, you’ll function as a key resource and subject matter expert for other engineers within the team and across the company.  You’ll collaborate with a wide range of other teams as you drive your own initiatives and assist with other projects.
